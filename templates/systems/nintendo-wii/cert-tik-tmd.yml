# STATUS: 1%
#
# encrypted files used in Wii, Wii-U, Switch, downloaded from Nintendo Update Servers (NUS).

# For Wii, the names are: tmd.bin, ticket.bin, cert.bin, h3.bin
# For Wii-U and Switch it is a collection of files: title.tmd, title.tik, title.cert, *.h3 *.app

# .app files
# Numbered starting from 0 (00000000.app) to however big the channel/game is.
#  App files contain the actual game data, encrypted and split into sections.
# To decrypt the content you need the title.tmd which stores the meta data for
# each .app and the title key for decryption (found in the ticket). With this
# data you can use a AES decrypter pass in the title key and you should be able to extract all the .app files.

# *.h3 files
# H3 files are file hashes to verify the downloaded .app file is correct (Each hash is a 20-byte SHA1)

# # title.cert (Certificate chain)
# Contains the certificates for the ticket and TMD signers, as well as the certificate authority.

# title.tik (Ticket)
# Contains the title ID, console ID (for downloaded titles), and encrypted title key.

# title.tmd (Title Metadata)
# The Title Metadata file (.tmd) contains the required IOS version (WiiUOS) and SHA-1 hashes of all of
# the title’s contents.

# The .tmd file contains all Sha1 of the content, but it’s a SHA1 hash of decrypted files, not encrypted
# .app files. So it requires decryption and file extraction to check integrity.
