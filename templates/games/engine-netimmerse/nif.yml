# NIF stands for "NetImmerse Format", which is a file type that was
# created for the NetImmerse engine in 1997. This later morphed into
# the Gamebryo Engine (used for Morrowind, Oblivion, and Fallout 3),
# which in turn was the basis for the Creation Engine, used by games
# such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76.
