# CVM is an archive format used in the PS2 versions of Persona 3 and Persona 4.
# It was developed by CRI Middleware and based on ISO9660. It is also known internally
# as "ROFS" format. Essentially, they are ISO files with a special header. Due to this,
# most programs that can normally extract ISOs can also extract CVMs.

### Extract .CMV
# Can extract .cmv from Persona 3 and Persona 4 with IsoBuster 5.
# Errors with Persona 3 FES.
