# TODO MAX: need to process the decompressed data

# TODO: Each block is its own file, with the exception of the last which is a filename block.

# TODO: The filename block consists of an 8-byte header, made up of a long representing the length of the whole filename block and a long representing the number of files. After this header are the filenames, each with a 12-byte header consisting of a long that represents the beginning of the file's block, a long that represents the length of this block, and a long that represents the length of the filename, followed by the (non-null-terminated) filename itself.

# TODO: The other blocks consist of an 8-byte header consisting of a long storing the length of the filename (null-terminated) and a long representing the length of the data in the block, followed by the filename and then the data.
