# STATUS: 50%, extract: some OK, fails on some files

# Similar to the older Neversoft hed-wad format but different order of file struct fields

# Used in:
# - Tony Hawk's Project 8 (2006) PS2 uses a different variation, where Offset is instead a number ...

# TODO: some bug with offset calculation from sector. maybe overflow in scripting engine?
#      -  "1047693 * 2048" = 0x7fe46800  but we get 0x7ff80d8c000 ... overflow
