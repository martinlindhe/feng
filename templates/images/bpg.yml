# STATUS: 1%

# XXX uses data type ue7(32) which is variable-bit:
# - ue7(n) is an unsigned integer of at most n bits stored on a variable
#  number of bytes. All the bytes except the last one have a '1' as
#  their first bit. The unsigned integer is represented as the
#  concatenation of the remaining 7 bit codewords. Only the shortest
#  encoding for a given unsigned integer shall be accepted by the
#  decoder (i.e. the first byte is never 0x80). Example:
#
#  Encoded bytes       Unsigned integer value
#  0x08                8
#  0x84 0x1e           542
#  0xac 0xbe 0x17      728855
